      <description>One of the best decisions I ever made in my career as a software engineer was to study books. Books have given me the opportunity to learn from the experts, to understand the principles and practices of software development, and to expand my knowledge and skills in various domains.
Of course, books are not the only source of learning for me. I also love to read engineering blogs, and watch conferences, but books help me to get well-rounded and comprehensive knowledge about the topic.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sumit, I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata .
During my four years of university, I explored various domains of computer science. The things that interested me the most are Distributed systems and backend engineering. I work primarily with backend technologies, learning to build scalable and resilient systems. I use Go for most of my work but I also have experience with Nodejs and C++.</description>
