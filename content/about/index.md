Hi, I'm Sumit, I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata .

During my four years of university, I explored various domains of computer science. The things that interested me the most are Distributed systems and backend engineering. I work primarily with backend technologies, learning to build scalable and resilient systems. I use Go for most of my work but I also have experience with Nodejs and C++. Apart from what I'm working with, I'm always open to learning and working with new technologies.

I'm a hobby reader, so learning new things comes naturally to me. In my leisure, I can be found on reddit or playing cricket.
